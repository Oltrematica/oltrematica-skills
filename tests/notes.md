# Test notes

Living documentation: evidence from standalone script tests against the
fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`. Append a dated section per test run.

## Fixtures

| Fixture | Ecosystems | Known-vulnerable pin |
|---------|------------|----------------------|
| `node-minimal` | npm (lockfileVersion 3) | lodash 4.17.15 — CVE-2020-8203, CVE-2021-23337, CVE-2020-28500 |
| `laravel-minimal` | composer | guzzlehttp/guzzle 7.4.0 — CVE-2022-31042/31043/31090/31091 |
| `polyglot` | npm + composer + Dockerfile | both of the above |

Lockfiles are hand-written (no installed `node_modules/` or `vendor/`) —
syft and grype read lockfiles directly. `compliance/` output generated inside
fixtures during tests is gitignored.
